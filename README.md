# JARVIS-
A for-fun project using Mediapipe and OpenCV to create a gesture-based computer interface mimicking "JARVIS" from the Marvel series.


About the code itself:

Consists of 2 chunks (may be subject to change in the future) 

- The main file with a majority of the messy code (sorry)
- A dependencies file for general functions that the program requires
